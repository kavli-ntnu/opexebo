def spatial_occupancy(time, position, speed, arena_size, **kwargs):
    '''
    Generate an occpuancy map: how much time the animal spent in each location
    in the arena.

    NOTES: This assumes that the positions have already been aligned and curated
    to remove NaNs. This is based on the expectation that it will primarily be
    used within the DataJoint framework, where the curation takes place at a
    much earlier stage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time: np.ndarray
        timestamps of position and speed data
    position: np.ndarray (x, [y])
        1d or 2d array of positions at timestamps. If 2d, then row major, such
        that `position[0]` corresponds to all `x`; and `position[1]` to all `y`
    speed: np.ndarray
        1d array of speeds at timestamps
    arena_size: float or tuple of floats
        Dimensions of arena (in cm)
            * For a linear track, length
            * For a circular arena, diameter
            * For a rectangular arena, length or (length, length)
    speed_cutoff: float
        Timestamps with instantaneous speed beneath this value are ignored. Default 0
    arena_shape: {"square", "rect", "circle", "line"}
        Rectangular and square are equivalent. Elliptical or n!=4 polygons
        not currently supported. Defaults to Rectangular
    bin_width: float
        Bin size in cm. Default 2.5cm. If bin_width is supplied, `limit` must
        also be supplied. One of `bin_width`, `bin_number`, `bin_edges` must be
        provided
    bin_number: int or tuple of int
        Number of bins. If provided as a tuple, then `(x_bins, y_bins)`. One
        of `bin_width`, `bin_number`, `bin_edges` must be provided
    bin_edges: array-like
        Edges of the bins. Provided either as `edges` or `(x_edges, y_edges)`.
        One of `bin_width`, `bin_number`, `bin_edges` must be provided
    limits: tuple or np.ndarray
        (x_min, x_max) or (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
        Provide concrete limits to the range over which the histogram searches
        Any observations outside these limits are discarded
        If no limits are provided, then use np.nanmin(data), np.nanmax(data)
        to generate default limits.
        As is standard in python, acceptable values include the lower bound
        and exclude the upper bound
    debug: bool, optional
        If `true`, print out debugging information throughout the function.
        Default `False`

    Returns
    -------
    masked_map: np.ma.MaskedArray
        Unsmoothed map of time the animal spent in each bin.
        Bins which the animal never visited are masked (i.e. the mask value is
        `True` at these locations)
    coverage: float
        Fraction of the bins that the animal visited. In range [0, 1]
    bin_edges: ndarray or tuple of ndarray
        x, or (x, y), where x, y are 1d np.ndarrays
        Here x, y correspond to the output histogram
