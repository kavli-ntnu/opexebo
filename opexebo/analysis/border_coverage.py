def border_coverage(fields, arena_shape, **kwargs):
    '''
    Calculate border coverage for detected fields.
    
    STATUS : EXPERIMENTAL
    
    This function calculates firing map border coverage that is further
    used in calculation of a border score. Coverage is calculated on a per-field
    basis, and is therefore dependent on the exact details of the place-field
    detection algorithm. 
    
    Additionally, please be aware of what `top` and `bottom` mean. This function
    treats `top` as the location where the `y` indicies are greatest. This is
    the standard convention in a GRAPH ((0,0) at bottom left, `x` increases to
    right and `y` increases to top). Images are conventionally plotted UPSIDE-
    DOWN, with `y` increasing towards the bottom.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fields: dict or list of dicts
        One dictionary per field. Each dictionary must contain the keyword field_map
    arena_shape: {"square", "rect", "circle", "line"}
        Rectangular and square are equivalent. Elliptical or n!=4 polygons
        not currently supported.
    
    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    search_width: int
        rate_map and fields_map have masked values, which may occur within the
        region of border pixels. To mitigate this, we check rows/columns within
        search_width pixels of the border Default `8`
    walls: str or list of tuple
        Definition of which walls to consider for border coverage. Behaviour is
        different for different arena shapes
        * Rectangular arenas
          type str. The four walls are referred to as `T`, `B`, `R`, `L` for the
          standard cardinals. Case insensitive. You may include or exclude any
        * Circular arenas
          Walls should be specified as a list of inclusive angular start-stop pairs. Angles
          given in degrees clockwise from top. Both `0` and `360` are permissible
          values. Start-stop may wrap through zero and may be overlapping with
          other pairs. Negative angles may be used to express counter-clockwise
          rotation, and will be automatically wrapped into the [0, 360] range.
          Example: [(0, 15), (180, 270), (315, 45), (30, 60)]
          Walls may ALTERNATIVELY be expressed as a string, equivalent to rectangular
          arenas. In this case, walls will be interpreted as follows
              * `T` - (315, 45)
              * `B` - (135, 225)
              * `L` - (45, 135)
              * `R` - (225, 315)
        In either case, defaults `TRBL`. Converting this (or other string) for
        circluar arrays is handled internally

    Returns
    -------
    coverage: float
        Border coverage, ranges from 0 to 1.

def _calculate_coverage_rect(fmap, wall, search_width, debug):
    '''
    Evaluate what fraction of the border area is covered by a single field in a
    rectangular or square arena

    Border coverage is provided as two values: 
        covered : the sum of the values across all sites immediately adjacent 
            to the border, where the values are calculated from the distance of
            those sites to the firing field, excluding NaN, inf, and masked values
        norm    : the number of non nan, inf, masked values considered in the 
            above sum

    The border area is defined by wfmap - this is the subsection of the binary 
    firing map of a  single field that lies within search_width of a border. 
    wfmap is must be of size NxM where
        N : arena_size / bin_size
