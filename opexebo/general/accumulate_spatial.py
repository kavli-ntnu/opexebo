def accumulate_spatial(pos, arena_size, **kwargs):
    """
    Given a list of positions, create a histogram of those positions. The
    resulting histogram is typically referred to as a map.
    
    The complexity in this function comes down to selecting where the edges of
    the arena are, and generating the bins within those limits.
    
    The histogram bin edges must be defined in one of 3 different ways
    
        * bin_width: based on the keyword `arena_size`, the number of bins will
          be calculated as
            `opexebo.general.bin_width_to_bin_number`
          The histogram will use `num_bins` between the minimum and maximum of the
          positions (or `limit` if provided)
        * bin_number: the histogram will use bin_number of bins between the
          minimum and maximum of the positions (or `limit` if provided)
        * bin_edges: the histogram will use the provided `bin_edg`e arrays

    Either zero or one of the three bin_* keyword arguments must be defined.
    If none are defined, then a default bin_width is used. If more than 1 is
    defined, an error is raised

    Parameters
    ----------
    pos: np.ndarray
        1D or 2D array of positions  in row-major format, i.e. `x` = pos[0],
        `y` = pos[1]. This matches the simplest input creation pos = np.array( [`x`, `y`] )
    arena_size: float or tuple of floats
        Dimensions of arena (in cm)
            * For a linear track, length
            * For a circular arena, diameter
            * For a rectangular arena, length or (length, length)
    bin_width: float
        Bin size in cm. Default 2.5cm. If bin_width is supplied, `limit` must
        also be supplied. One of `bin_width`, `bin_number`, `bin_edges` must be
        provided
    bin_number: int or tuple of int
        Number of bins. If provided as a tuple, then `(x_bins, y_bins)`. One
        of `bin_width`, `bin_number`, `bin_edges` must be provided
    bin_edges: array-like
        Edges of the bins. Provided either as `edges` or `(x_edges, y_edges)`.
        One of `bin_width`, `bin_number`, `bin_edges` must be provided
    limits: tuple or np.ndarray
        (x_min, x_max) or (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
        Provide concrete limits to the range over which the histogram searches
        Any observations outside these limits are discarded
        If no limits are provided, then use np.nanmin(data), np.nanmax(data)
        to generate default limits.
        As is standard in python, acceptable values include the lower bound
        and exclude the upper bound

    Returns
    -------
    hist: np.ndarray
        1D or 2D histogram of the occurrences of the input observations
        Dimensions given by arena_size/bin_width
        Not normalised - each cell gives the integer number of occurrences of
        the observation in that cell
    edges: list-like
        `x`, or (`x`, `y`), where `x`, `y` are 1d np.ndarrays
        Here `x`, `y` correspond to the output histogram

        A brief word on the documentation for np.histogram2d()
        https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram2d.html
        
        The documentation is subtlely misleading in the use of `x` and `y`. 
        
        The NumPy standard notation is (almost) invariably to call (y, x), and, e.g.,
        in a 2D array, you would create an array with 5 rows and 2 columns like follows:
            np.zeros((5, 2))
        
        We would normally describe this as an array with a height (corresponding to y)
        of 5, and a width (corresponding to x) of 2.
        
        The documentation for histogram2d gives the signature as:
            numpy.histogram2d(x, y, bins=10, range=None, normed=None, weights=None, density=None)
        
            Returns:
                H : ndarray, shape(nx, ny)
                    The bi-dimensional histogram of samples x and y. Values in x are 
                    histogrammed along the first dimension and values in y are histogrammed 
                    along the second dimension.
                xedges : ndarray, shape(nx+1,)
                    The bin edges along the first dimension.
                yedges : ndarray, shape(ny+1,)
                    The bin edges along the second dimension.
        
        Note the order in the Returns section: data given as `x` is histogrammed along the
        _first_ dimension, which in NumPy parlance, would _usually_ be labelled `y`.
        The use of `x`, `y` is self-consistent within this page, but misleading
        in the context of other NumPy functions. 
        
        By invoking `y` as the first axis, and then returning edges as [xedges, yedges],
        we are internally consistent with the mathematical notation that I have used throughout
        opexebo (i.e. to call x, then y)
